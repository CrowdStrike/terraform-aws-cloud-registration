# FCS Single Account Registration Example

This example demonstrates how to register a single AWS account with CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security (FCS) using an AWS CLI profile. It showcases the deployment of multiple FCS features including Real-time Visibility, Identity Protection (IDP), Sensor Management, and DSPM.

## Features Enabled

- Asset Inventory
- Real-time Visibility (using existing CloudTrail)
- Identity Protection (IDP)
- Sensor Management
- Data Security and Posture Management (DSPM)

## Prerequisites

1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
2. [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) installed
3. CrowdStrike API credentials (see [Pre-requisites](../../README.md#pre-requisites) for details)
4. AWS CLI profile with appropriate permissions

## Deploy

1. Set required environment variables:
```sh
export TF_VAR_falcon_client_id=<your client id>
export TF_VAR_falcon_client_secret=<your client secret>
export TF_VAR_account_id=<your aws account id>
export TF_VAR_aws_profile=<your aws profile>
```

2. Initialize and apply Terraform:
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Enter `yes` at command prompt to apply

## DSPM Configurations

### Cross Account Scanning

The account in the example is configured to host DSPM scanning infrastructure.

Alternate configuration options:
- You may choose to scan this account from a previously onboarded DSPM host account. To scan from a different account:
    * Ensure the deployment has successfully completed in the host account before deploying any target accounts.
    * Set the value of the variable `agentless_scanning_host_account_id` as your host AWS account ID.
    * Set the value of the variable `agentless_scanning_host_role_name` as the name of the DSPM integration role in the host account.
    * Set the value of the variable `agentless_scanning_host_scanner_role_name` as the name of the DSPM data scanner role in the host account.

### Custom VPC
For DSPM deployments, you can optionally use your existing network resources instead of the default resources provisioned by CrowdStrike.

**Key Points:**
- Custom VPC settings apply to the entire DSPM deployment across all regions
- Cannot be applied to specific DSPM regions (all-or-nothing configuration)
- Requires existing VPC, subnets, and security groups in each DSPM region

For detailed network requirements and validation steps, see the CrowdStrike Falcon documentation for DSPM deployment with custom VPCs.

**Usage:**
```hcl
  # Enable custom VPC
  agentless_scanning_use_custom_vpc = true
  
  # Provide existing resources for each region
  agentless_scanning_custom_vpc_resources_map = {
    "us-east-1" = {
      vpc            = "vpc-11223344556677889"
      scanner_subnet = "subnet-11223344556677887"
      scanner_sg     = "sg-11223344556677888"
      db_subnet_a    = "subnet-11223344556677888"
      db_subnet_b    = "subnet-11223344556677889"
      db_sg          = "sg-11223344556677889"
    }
    "us-west-1" = {
      vpc            = "vpc-11223344556677888"
      scanner_subnet = "subnet-11223344556677884"
      scanner_sg     = "sg-11223344556677886"
      db_subnet_a    = "subnet-11223344556677885"
      db_subnet_b    = "subnet-11223344556677886"
      db_sg          = "sg-11223344556677887"
    }
  }
```

## Destroy

To teardown and remove all resources created by this example:

```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
