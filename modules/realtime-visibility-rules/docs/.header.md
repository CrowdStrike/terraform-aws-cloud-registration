## Introduction

Falcon Cloud Security performs behavior assessments to identify indicators of attack (IOA) and cloud assets in real time. IOAs are patterns of suspicious behavior that suggest an attack might be underway.

This terraform module deploys the EventBridge rules in an AWS cloud environment in order to enable Real-time visibility and detection feature. See [realtime-visibility](../realtime-visibility/README.md) module to deploy global resources for this feature.
