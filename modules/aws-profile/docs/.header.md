## Introduction

This Terraform module allows onboarding multiple aws regions within the same module call, addressing specific challenges in Terraform's native multi-region deployment capabilities. Generally CI/CD pipelines and other orchestration tools are common approaches for multi-region deployments, and are still recommeded over using this module.

The module achieves multi-region deployment by defining provider blocks internally. These `aws` provider blocks will use the provided `aws_prfoile` to authenticate. This design choice does create certain limitations to be aware of; for example, the module is not compatible with Terraform's `for_each`, `count`, and `depends_on` arguments. Your workflow for destroying resources defined in this module will be also be impacted see [Running Terraform Destroy](#Running-Terraform-Destroy). You can learn more about the implications by reading [terraform's documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/providers#legacy-shared-modules-with-provider-configurations).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommeded to use the root module `CrowdStrike/cloud-registration/aws` over this wrapper module.

## Running Terraform Destroy

When working with this module, you need to be aware of a specific behavior related to resource destruction due to how provider blocks are managed internally.

The issue occurs in this specific scenario:

1. You have a module block in your configuration that uses this multi-region module
2. You decide to remove that module block from your configuration
3. You run `terraform apply` expecting Terraform to automatically destroy the resources that were created by the module
4. Instead of destroying resources, you get an error about missing provider configurations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This issue only occurs when you remove the module block from your configuration. If you're destroying your entire Terraform configuration using terraform destroy, you won't encounter this problem because the provider configurations are still available during the destroy process.

For example, if you remove this module block from your configuration:

```hcl
module "account" {
  source                      = "CrowdStrike/cloud-registration/aws//modules/aws-profile"
  aws_profile                 = var.aws_profile
  falcon_client_id            = var.falcon_client_id
  # Other parameters...
  realtime_visibility_regions = ["us-west-1"]
}
```

And then run `terraform apply`, you'll encounter an error like:

```
Error: Provider configuration not present

To work with module.account.module.rtvd_us_west_1[0].aws_cloudwatch_event_target.ro (orphan) its original provider configuration at
module.account.provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws"].us-west-1 is required, but it has been removed. This occurs when a provider
configuration is removed while objects created by that provider still exist in the state. Re-add the provider configuration to destroy
module.account.module.rtvd_us_west_1[0].aws_cloudwatch_event_target.ro (orphan), after which you can remove the provider configuration again.
```

This happens because removing the module block also removes the internal provider configurations that Terraform needs to destroy the resources.

### Solution: Targeted Destruction
Before removing the module from your configuration, destroy the resources using a targeted destroy command:

```
terraform destroy -target="module.account"
```
After the resources are destroyed, you can safely remove the module from your configuration and run terraform apply.
