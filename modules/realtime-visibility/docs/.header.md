## Introduction

This Terraform module deploys AWS resources required for CrowdStrike's Real-time Visibility and Detection feature, which identifies indicators of attack (IOAs) and monitors cloud asset behavior in real-time. Note: This module must be deployed separately in each AWS region you wish to monitor, as it manages region-specific resources.
